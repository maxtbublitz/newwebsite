                <h3>The problem</h3>
                <p >Undergoing anesthesia is incredibly stressfull for children, espicially children between the ages of 3 and 7. anesthesiologists struggle getting the mask secured to the childs face, and in some surgeries children have to be sedated to administer anesthesia.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="heading2">
                <h3>The Current Solution</h3>
                <p>The prevailing method employed to lower anxiety is to let the child play a game on an iPad. This has seen some success, however, an immersive and interactive experience could prove to be much more succesfull.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>The Breatheasy Solution</h3>
                <p>Breatheasy is an interactive experience that is designed to lower the anxiety in children undergoing anesthesia. Children progress through a series of themed levels, with breathing being the only way to interact with the game.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="heading4">
                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>Getting an MRI scan is also stressfull for children. Over three quarters of children who get MRI scans need to be sedated in order to get a propper scan.</p>
                <p>Doug Dietz is an industrial designer who wanted to better this dreadfull experience for children. He and his team designed themed enviornments around the MRI machine that engage the childs imagination, and incorporated the machine into these enviornments. The MRI rooms are transformed from bleak, sterile rooms to immersive spaces.</p>

            <div id="heading5">
                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>Less than 1% of children who get scans in these MRI machiens have to be sedated. Children get excited to enter the room and play. Doug even overheard one young girl ask her mom after the scan: "can we come back tomorrow?"</p>

            <div id="heading6">
                <h3>Integration</h3>
                <p>A virtual experience on its own would not be inticing enough to the childs imagination. An element was needed that would tie the physical world to the virtual experience. The mask was chosen as the element to help assosiate the experience and game, as the mask and game were designed with a common theme.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="heading7">
                <h3>Theme</h3>
                <p>An underwater theme was chosen for the project. This way, the anesthesiologist could tell the child that they'd need to put on the mask to breathe underwater to play. The mask was designed to look like a fish, and the child is allowed to pick between a few masks at the start of the experience, giving them a small but important sense of control over the experience.</p>

            <div id="heading8">
                <h3>Levels</h3>
                <p>To keep the child engaged, five themed levels were designed, and the only way to interact with them is through breathing. Breathing triggers animations on the screen, such as the lights turning on in a submarine.</p>
